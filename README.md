# BruteForce Password Cracking Script

This is a simple Python script for performing brute force password cracking. The script attempts to guess a password by systematically checking all possible combinations of characters, including letters, digits, and punctuation marks.

## Features

- The script supports lowercase and uppercase letters, digits, and punctuation marks.
- It prints the current attempt for each generated combination.
- Once the passkey is found, it stops the brute force search and prints the found passkey.
- It handles different password lengths starting from 1 and increases the length iteratively until the correct passkey is found.

## Requirements

- Python
- Standard Python libraries (no external dependencies)

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Run the script in a terminal or command prompt.

### Example

```bash
python BruteForce.py
